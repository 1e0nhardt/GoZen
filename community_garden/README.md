# Welcome to the community garden!

## What is the garden?

The 'garden' is where all officially approved community modules/effects can be found. 

## I want to add my module/effect

Everybody is free to create an issue with the information needed to add their module/effect. Everything will be tested and there is no guarantee that your module will be allowed. You need to have a GitHub release of your module and it has to be open source.

**Requirements**

- Needs to be open source;
- Does not contain malicious code;
- Needs to be free (nothing locked behind a paywall);
- Needs to be maintained to work with newer versions of GoZen.

**Info required**

1. Module/Effect name;
1. Type (effect or module);
1. Current version;
1. Possible requirements (Other modules/effects);
1. A square icon.

*For type also specify what type of effects or module it is!*
*Is the module an editor,files view, ...*
*Is the effect an audio, visual, ...*

### When your module/effect has a new version

Whenever you create a new version, we will have to manually check this again to be certain that it does still fullfil the above mentioned requirements.

You can or create a pull request (in the development branch) with the changes, or open an issue.
