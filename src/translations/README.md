# Translations

At this stage we have a couple of different languages available inside of the editor.

- English;
- Japanese;
- French;
- Dutch.

## All languages welcome!

If you want to provide language support by entering your language or adjusting/adding to already existing languages then please feel free to do so. No need to ask for permission. When adding/changing a language, please follow the guidelines bellow to create a smooth and effort free experience.

## How to contribute

Before contributing, you have to fork this repository and create a new branch called something like 'language_*language-code* update/addition'. When you are done making your changes you can create a pull request.

The way to contribute is by adding/changing your desired language in the translations.csv file. Respect the csv structure of the file, a good way to do this is by opening it in a spreadsheet app.

## Nodes folder

We also have certain resources that change for languages. Inside of the nodes folder, copy one of each type, change the ending to your language code. Translate the inside of the scene and done.

# Future languages

We don't have any specific plans for adding more languages in the future. Language support will completely depend on the support of the community.
